# CS 122: [Final Exam Review Jeopardy Game](Final-Review-Jeopardy.html)

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the comprehensive, interactive Jeopardy game designed to prepare you for the CS 122 Final Exam! This game covers Lectures 10 through 17 and emphasizes the **application of concepts, trade-offs in data structures, and integrated problem-solving** needed for both the multiple-choice and programming challenge sections of the final assessment.

Use this game as a way to test your conceptual knowledge and identify any topics (especially recursion, file I/O, and collections) you may want to review further.

## How We'll Play in Class

We will play this game together during our scheduled final review session.

* **Teams:** The class will be divided into two teams.
* **Gameplay:** The active team will choose a category and a point value. The host (Prof. Sarah L) will read the "answer," and the first team to buzz in must respond in the form of a question.
* **Scoring:** Correct responses earn points, while incorrect responses deduct points. The team that answers correctly gains control of the board for the next question.

**Example of Gameplay:**

> 1.  **A team chooses:** "15. Exception Handling for $400".
> 2.  **The host reads the clue:** "The type of exception, such as `IOException`, that the compiler forces you to handle."
> 3.  **The team buzzes in and responds:** "What is a **checked exception**?"
> 4.  **Result:** That is correct! The team earns 400 points and gets to choose the next question.
